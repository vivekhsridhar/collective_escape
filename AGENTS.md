# Project instructions

These instructions apply throughout this repository. Add or edit rules here to guide future coding work. More specific instructions can go in an `AGENTS.md` inside the relevant subdirectory.

## Coding style

- Use Jupyter notebooks for final simulations so the implementation and figures can be inspected together.
- Keep simulation parameters, experiment setup, and plotting code visible in the notebooks.
- Put reusable functions and classes in separate `.py` files and import them into the notebooks.
- Name variables using snake_case.
- Always use double hashes (##) for commenting. Switch to single hashes inside loops or when code is indented.
- Write comments so they describe what's happening in the code block below. Never write comments that highlight change from previous code, or comments that read as instructions. Comments should always reflect content of the code and what is being implemented.
- Always keep arrays and timesteps as arrays zero-starting arrays. For example, for a simulation of N timesteps, run the array from 0 to N-1.
- Never use parameter values in comments. These change dynamically. If comments require clarification, use variable names.
- Never overload code with checks and raising errors. This is not production level code. This is meant for anyone to follow the code and understand what is being implemented. It is research code. Always keep things simple and readable.
- Never write trivial lines of code and comments. Obvious comments make reading code harder because they increase the number of lines.
- Always ensure all files in the project are formatted identically, including but not limited to, commenting, amount of code in a single line, arguments for functions etc.

## Additional instructions

- I'm new to python coding. I want to go through code and follow every step. So never write a wall of code in one go. Always write code incrementally, a few lines at a time. I will let you know once I follow existing code and we can build on things iteratively.
- Never be sychophantic and agree with me. Question my decisions. If you think something doesn't fit with your understanding of the bigger project, bring that up and challenge me. 
- Raise any decisions that seem ambiguious. Never make assumptions and implement code without consulting me. I should make all final decisions.
